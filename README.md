# OnlineRetailML

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on a dataset to predict countries based on specified features. The script compares the results of both algorithms and provides insights into their accuracy.

## Dataset:
Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and includes features such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, and CustomerID.

## Run the Script:

Execute the Python script, ensuring that you have the required libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn).

## Comparison:
The script trains both Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, compares their predictions, and evaluates accuracy.

### Results and Comparison:
Displays a DataFrame showing predicted vs. expected countries for both algorithms.
Computes and compares accuracy scores.
Identifies mismatched records for analysis.
Future Applications:
### Parameter Tuning: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
### Larger Datasets: Assess scalability and performance on larger datasets.
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features for improved predictions.
Deployment: Adapt the code for deployment in production environments.
Feel free to customize the script and explore further enhancements for your specific use case.
